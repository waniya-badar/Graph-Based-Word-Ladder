# Graph-Based-Word-Ladder
Graph Based Word Ladder - a cross-language implementation of the Word Ladder game using graph theory, designed to find the shortest and longest transformation sequences between two words. Implemented in Python and MATLAB with comparative performance analysis.

### Project Overview
This project models words as nodes in a graph, with edges between words that differ by only one letter. It showcases the use of Breadth-First Search (BFS) and Depth-First Search (DFS) to solve the Word Ladder problem.

### Objectives
Develop algorithms to find the shortest and longest transformation sequences.

Represent words and transitions using graph data structures.

Compare execution time, memory usage, and efficiency between Python and MATLAB.

Analyze practical applications of graph traversal in linguistics.

### Implementation Details
#### Graph Construction
Nodes = Valid words

Edges = One-letter transformations

Adjacency List = Constructed using dictionaries in both Python and MATLAB

#### Algorithms
Shortest Path → Implemented using BFS

Longest Path → Implemented using DFS/Backtracking
